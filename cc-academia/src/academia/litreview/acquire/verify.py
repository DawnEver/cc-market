"""Artifact verification — the single definition of "is this a usable PDF".

These three helpers previously existed twice, in `acquire/download.py` and
`pipeline/acquire.py`, with *different* acceptance rules: the download side
checked only the magic bytes, the manifest side also required a minimum size.
A truncated stub therefore passed download and failed later at manifest time,
after the queue had already recorded it as a success. One definition, used by
both, is the only way that stays fixed.
